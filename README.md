## Notes

Notes to self - Wordle Project CodePath iOS 101
Exercise 4: Tried assigning closure to class instead of instance, fixed with cell.didSelectString = didSelectString
Exercise 5: Worked fine, used didSelectString?(string) for safety
Exercise 6: Called method on class instead of instance, fixed by calling on cell
Exercise 7: Forgot to assign result of scaledBy, fixed with cell.transform = cell.transform.scaledBy(...)
Exercise 9: Used UIColor without labels, fixed with labeled init and added .cgColor for borderColor
